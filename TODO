# TODO

So anyway

What we need to do is 

- create a piece class
	- what variables for the tiles?
	- drop them in without having them fall through
		- so the bottom of the canvas is a blocking wall (the brick breaker tutorial shows how to do wall bouncing, should be similar)


- create a player variable
	- used to determine colors
	- i.e. p1 is the color and identifier for drawing P1's pieces, checking if they have 4 in a row


- create keyboard interaction
	- or mouse? I don't know what the best way to "drop" is

- set up mongo db 
	- used to track players and high scores?
		- how does scoring work?

- decide on "max" level of game play
	- I think 4 is appropriate
		- e.g. [1|1|1|1] ==> [4] and then from that point on, you get [4] tiles dropped
			- then connect [4|4|4|4]
			- then you win
			- but what is the score? how much time it takes you? idk
